# Weather Monitoring System:
It helps to monitor and indicate the weather around the surroundings. I have also used LED's to indicate the temperature in various climates.
1. If the value of temperature > 70째C = It glows Red = Which Indicated Hot.
2. If the value of temperature < 20째C = It glows Blue = Which Indicates Cold.
3. If the value of temperature is between 20째C and 70째C = It glows Yellow = Which Indicates Medium.

# Circuit Design:

![Circuit Design](https://github.com/ahamedbasha-n/weather-monitoring-system/blob/main/Circuit%20Design.jpg)

# How I built it:
Tinkercad Software to make use of the Hardware Modules and Components.

# Hardware Requirements:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Bread Board
3. Resistors
4. LED Light (1-Red, 1-Green, 1-Yellow)
5. Piezo Electric Cell
6. Potentiometer
7. Display

# Challenges we ran into:
Fixing the Circuit and assembling with the resistor with LED's was a task.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of:
This is my First Hardware cum Software Project dedicated for Weather Monitoring Purposes.

# What we learned:
Python, Arduino Embedded Code, Hardware Assembling.
